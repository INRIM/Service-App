### Datagrid
The datagrid is a component that can contain other components.  
To activate the possibility of adding more rows in a datagrid it is necessary to complete
the fields **Minimum Length , Maximum Length** in the tab **Validation** during component configuration: e.g **Minimum Length: 1 , Maximum Length: 4** activate the datagrid with the default first row that cannot be deleted and the “+” button to add rows up to a maximum of 4.

In the process of creating a panel **datagrid** to manage the layout of the component lines it is necessary to insert a component of type [column](../layout/columns.md#it-does-not-require-additional-configurations-if-necessary-use-the-standard-configurations) in order to define the size of the columns
