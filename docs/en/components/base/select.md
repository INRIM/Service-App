**Tab Data configuration [fig.1]:**  
- Data Source Type → Url
- Data Source URL → /models/distinct

**Configurazione Tab API → Custom Properties [fig.2]:**  
- **Id →** rec_name (it is the value that is used as option val in the select list) 
- **label →** the name of the field considered indicative for the user (e.gTitle)
- **domain →** {} query domain to apply to reduce the list to the desired dataset
- **model →** the rec_name of the Form from which you want to extract the information.
